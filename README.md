Simple LSTM (RNN) with spoofed time series sales data; TensorBoard!

I set out here to implement a simple Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to perform simple forecasting. First we generate a .csv of spoofed sales data (time series), taking care to introduce seasonality into the data, then we are using Tensorflow (Keres API) to build and train the model. 

Graphical output with TensorBoard on local server FTW!
